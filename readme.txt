This plugin simply keeps synced username with email. Just activate it: it's ready-to-use, no options needed.

== Description ==

In some cases you want your wordpress users to login with their email address instead of the username. To do this, you can use a good plugin like 'WP Email Login' or you can activate a 'Register Plus Redux' plugin's option, but when the users will ask for lost password, the old / original username will be emailed to them, and this can cause confusion. To avoid this situation, just install and activate Login Email Sync, and it will sync the username ( user_login database field ) with the email ( user_email database field ) every time a user updates her/his profile.
